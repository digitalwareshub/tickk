## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Vision
Transform Tickk from a free voice productivity app into a sustainable SaaS business while maintaining our core promise: **basic features free forever**.

### Core Principle
**Never compromise the free user experience.** The free tier must remain genuinely useful, not a crippled teaser.

### Revenue Goal
- **Month 6:** $5K MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- **Year 1:** $50K ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- **Year 2:** $500K ARR

### Target Conversion Rate
- **3-5%** of free users convert to Pro within 90 days
- **10%** of users hitting 500-item limit upgrade

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

### Three-Tier Model

#### **Free Tier (Forever Free)**
**Target:** 95% of users
**Purpose:** User acquisition, brand building, community growth

**Limits:**
- 500 total items (tasks + notes combined)
- 30 days of history retention

- ✅ Unlimited voice recordings
- ✅ Smart NLP classification
- ✅ Voice-first interface
- ✅ Offline PWA functionality
- ✅ English + Spanish support
- ✅ Basic task management
- ✅ Note organization
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts

**Why 500 Items?**
- Average user creates 10 items/week
- 500 items = ~1 year of use
- Generous enough to not feel restrictive
- High enough to build dependency
- Creates natural upgrade moment

#### **Pro Tier - $4.99/month or $49/year**
**Target:** 3-5% of users (power users, professionals)
**Value Proposition:** "Unlimited power for productivity enthusiasts"

**What You Get:**
- ✅ **Unlimited storage** (no 500-item limit)

- ✅ **Priority support** (24-hour email response)
- ✅ **Pro badge** (show your support)
- ✅ **Early access** (test features first)

**Why Pro Works:**
- Targets 3-5% who use app daily
- Priced at cost of 1 coffee/month
- Clear value: unlimited vs limited
- "Unlock your full potential" positioning

#### **Enterprise Tier - Custom Pricing**
**Target:** <1% of users (companies, teams)
**Minimum:** 5 users @ $12/user/month

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Feature Flag System (Already Implemented ✅)

```typescript
// Feature flags control visibility
FEATURES = {
  MONETIZATION: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MONETIZATION === 'true',
  PRO_TIER: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_PRO_TIER === 'true',
  PRICING_PAGE: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PRICING === 'true',
  USAGE_QUOTAS: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QUOTAS === 'true',
  STRIPE_INTEGRATION: env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_STRIPE === 'true',
  // ... more flags
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Build features in production without exposing them
- ✅ Enable/disable instantly (no code deploy)
- ✅ A/B testing ready
- ✅ Gradual rollout capability
- ✅ Instant rollback if issues

### User Data Model (New)

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string                    // UUID
  email?: string               // Optional for free tier
  createdAt: Date
  plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'
  subscription?: {
    stripeCustomerId: string
    stripeSubscriptionId: string
    status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due'
    currentPeriodEnd: Date
    cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean
  }
  quota: {
    maxItems: number           // 500 for free, 0 (unlimited) for pro
    maxHistoryDays: number     // 30 for free, 0 (unlimited) for pro
  }
  usage: {
    totalItems: number         // Current count
    oldestItemDate: Date      // For history enforcement
    createdThisMonth: number  // For analytics
  }
  preferences: {
    emailNotifications: boolean
    weeklyReports: boolean
    upgradePrompts: boolean   // Can dismiss upgrade prompts
  }
}
```

### Storage Architecture

**Current (Free Tier):**
```
IndexedDB (local) → localStorage (fallback)
```

**Pro Tier Addition:**
```
IndexedDB (local) → Cloud Backup (E2E encrypted) → User's Google Drive/Dropbox
                 ↓
          Sync Engine (optional future feature)
```

**Data Flow:**
```
1. User creates item → IndexedDB (instant)
2. Background job → Check quota limits
3. If Pro: Encrypt → Upload to user's cloud
4. Daily cleanup: Remove items >30 days (free tier only)
```

### Payment Architecture

**Stripe Integration:**
```
Frontend                Backend (API Routes)           Stripe
   |                           |                         |
   |-- Checkout Session ------>|-- Create Session ------>|
   |<------ URL ----------------|<----- Session ID -------|
   |                           |                         |
   |-- User pays on Stripe ----|------------------------>|
   |                           |                         |
   |                           |<-- Webhook (success) ---|
   |                           |-- Update DB ----------->|
   |                           |-- Send email ---------->|
   |<------ Redirect ----------|                         |
   |  (Success page)           |                         |
```

**Webhook Events Handled:**
- `checkout.session.completed` → Activate Pro
- `customer.subscription.updated` → Update status
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Cancel Pro
- `invoice.payment_failed` → Alert user
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Extend subscription

## 🔧 Feature Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Pricing Page
**Location:** `/pricing`
**Components:**
- Hero section with value proposition
- Feature comparison table (Free vs Pro vs Enterprise)
- FAQ section (address common concerns)
- Social proof (testimonials, user count)
- CTA buttons (Start Free, Upgrade to Pro)

**Design:**
- Clean, minimal, on-brand
- Mobile-responsive
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Fast loading (<2s LCP)

**Copy Strategy:**
- Focus on "unlock" not "limited"
- Emphasize value, not features
- ADHD-friendly language
- Clear, honest pricing

**Feature Flag:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PRICING`

#### 1.2 Usage Quota System
**Purpose:** Track and enforce 500-item limit for free tier

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class QuotaService {
  async checkQuota(userId: string): Promise<QuotaStatus> {
    const user = await getUser(userId)
    const totalItems = await countItems(userId)

    if (user.plan === 'free' && totalItems >= 500) {
      return { exceeded: true, current: totalItems, limit: 500 }
    }

    return { exceeded: false, current: totalItems, limit: user.quota.maxItems }
  }

  async getQuotaProgress(userId: string): Promise<QuotaProgress> {
    // Returns: { used: 350, limit: 500, percentage: 70 }
  }
}
```

**UI Indicators:**
- Progress bar in footer: "350 / 500 items used (70%)"
- Warning at 450 items: "Running out of space! Upgrade for unlimited"
- Soft block at 500: Modal suggesting upgrade
- Hard block at 520: Cannot create new items without deleting old ones

**Grace Period:**
- Users can exceed to 520 items (4% buffer)
- Prevents frustration from "just one more item"
- Encourages cleanup or upgrade

**Feature Flag:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_QUOTAS`

#### 1.3 User Accounts (Optional for Free Tier)
**Strategy:** Email-based magic links (no passwords)

**Why Optional for Free:**
- Keep "no sign-up" promise
- Data stays local by default
- Accounts only needed for:
  - Cloud backup (Pro feature)
  - Cross-device sync (future)
  - Subscription management

**Flow:**
```
Free User (No Account)
  ↓
Hits 500 items
  ↓
Wants to upgrade
  ↓
"Enter email to continue" → Magic link → Account created → Stripe checkout
  ↓
Now has account + Pro subscription
```

**Implementation:**
- NextAuth.js with email provider
- Store user ID in localStorage
- Sync local data to account on creation
- Privacy-first: minimal data collection

---

### Phase 2: Pro Features (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Advanced Export Formats

**Current (Free):**

}
```

**UI:**

**Strategy:** Users control their data, we never see it

**Encryption Flow:**
```
1. User data → Encrypt with user's password/key
2. Encrypted blob → Upload to user's cloud
3. Only user can decrypt (we don't have the key)
4. Backup filename: tickk-backup-2025-10-23.encrypted
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/backup/cloud-backup.ts
class CloudBackupService {
  async backup(provider: 'gdrive' | 'dropbox'): Promise<void> {
    const data = await StorageService.exportAll()
    const encrypted = await this.encrypt(data, userKey)
    await this.uploadToCloud(provider, encrypted)
  }

  async restore(provider: 'gdrive' | 'dropbox'): Promise<void> {
    const encrypted = await this.downloadFromCloud(provider)
    const decrypted = await this.decrypt(encrypted, userKey)
    await StorageService.importAll(decrypted)
  }
}
```

**UI:**
- Settings page: "Connect Cloud Storage"
- OAuth flow for provider authentication
- Automatic daily backups (configurable)
- Manual backup/restore buttons
- Last backup timestamp display

**Privacy Marketing:**
- "Your data, your cloud, your control"
- "We never see your data - E2E encrypted"
- "You own the backup, not us"

  → Opens tasks view, filters by today
```

**Implementation:**

class VoiceCommandParser {
  parse(transcript: string): VoiceCommand | null {
    const patterns = [
      /hey tickk,?\s+add\s+(high|medium|low)?\s*priority?\s*task:?\s*(.+)/i,
      /hey tickk,?\s+note:?\s*(.+)/i,
      /hey tickk,?\s+show\s+(.+)/i,
    ]
    // Parse and return structured command

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Week 4)

#### 5.1 Stripe Test Mode

**Test Scenarios:**

- ✅ 3D Secure (card: 4000 0027 6000 3184)
- ✅ Subscription cancellation
- ✅ Subscription reactivation
- ✅ Webhook delivery
- ✅ Failed webhook retry

**Test Users:**

#### 5.2 Quota Testing

**Test Cases:**
- Create exactly 500 items → Verify soft block
- Create 520 items → Verify hard block
- Delete items → Verify quota updates
- Export data at quota → Should still work
- Upgrade at quota → Immediately unlock

#### 5.3 Edge Cases

**Handle:**
- User with no email upgrades → Force email entry
- Payment succeeds but webhook fails → Manual reconciliation
- User deletes account with active subscription → Cancel first
- User has >500 items, then downgrades → Warning + grace period
- Multiple tabs open → Sync quota across tabs
- Offline upgrade attempt → Queue for when online

#### 5.4 Performance

**Targets:**
- Pricing page loads in <2s
- Checkout redirect in <500ms
- Webhook processing in <5s
- Quota check in <100ms
- Export generation in <3s (PDF)

**Optimization:**
- Lazy load Stripe.js
- Cache quota checks (30s)
- Background export generation
- CDN for static assets

#### 5.5 Accessibility

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (pricing, checkout, modals)
- ✅ Screen reader support (announce quota status)
- ✅ Color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- ✅ Focus indicators (visible outline)
- ✅ ARIA labels (buttons, links, forms)

**Test With:**
