      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>We've been typing for so long that we've forgotten what it costs us. Every day, millions of people sit down to capture their thoughts, plan their work, and organize their lives — all through the narrow bottleneck of a keyboard. We've accepted this as normal. Productive, even. But there's a hidden tax we pay every time our fingers hit the keys, and it's costing us more than we realize.</p>
        
        <p>The average person thinks at roughly 400 words per minute. We speak at about 150 words per minute. But we type? Just 40 words per minute. That's a 90% reduction in bandwidth between thought and capture.</p>
        
        <p>When you type, you're asking your brain to do two completely different things at once. First, you need to formulate language — converting abstract thoughts into words and sentences. Second, you need to coordinate the physical act of typing — remembering where keys are, moving your fingers precisely, correcting mistakes.</p>
        
        <p>Voice-first capture isn't about technology replacing typing. It's about using the right tool for the right job. Your brain is optimized for speech, not keyboards. Your thoughts move faster than your fingers ever will.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Discover why forcing thoughts into categories while having them kills creativity. Learn the braindump-first approach that captures everything, then organizes later. Explore the science behind task-switching penalty, decision fatigue, and why voice capture works with your brain's natural architecture instead of against it.]]></description>

        <p>You're in the shower. Or driving. Or just about to fall asleep. Suddenly – that idea. The solution to the problem. The perfect opening line. The thing you've been trying to remember.</p>
        
        <p>You grab your phone, open your productivity app, and then... "Is this a task or a note? What project? What tag? What priority? What due date?" By the time you've answered the app's twenty questions, the idea has dissolved.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Your productivity app just killed your productivity.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Here's what nobody talks about: Your brain doesn't think in categories. When ideas come, they don't arrive pre-sorted into "Tasks," "Notes," "Projects," and "Reminders." They come as a messy, beautiful stream of consciousness.</p>
        
        <p>What if you could capture first and organize later? What if your app worked like your brain actually works? This is the principle behind braindump-first productivity: Separate the capture phase from the organization phase.</p>
